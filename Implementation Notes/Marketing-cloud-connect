Troubleshooting: 

Clearing Marketing Cloud Connect Configuration

If none of the above helped, you can try clearing the Marketing Cloud Connect configuration and re-configuring it from scratch.

As a first step, you will have to add the “Configurations” tab to your Sales/Service Cloud:

Click Setup
Follow the steps based on your UI:
Salesforce Classic: Under the “Create” category, select Tabs
Salesforce Lightning: Under the “User Interface” category, select Tabs
Click New
Choose “Configurations” from the Object drop-down menu
Pick any Tab style
Click Next > Next > Save
Once the tab has been added, navigate to it by clicking the Plus symbol on the tab bar and click on the Configurations link. Now delete the existing configuration:

Choose All under the “View” drop-down, and then click Go
Delete the existing Configuration Object
Now you are ready to re-configure Marketing Cloud Connect:

Click the Marketing Cloud tab
Enter the Marketing Cloud API Username and Password
Select values for Send Types, Target Audience, Exclusion Audience, Support Ticket Recipient, and Tracking Preferences
Click Marketing Cloud Tab once more, re-integrate individual Users as needed


Other Tips: 
- Make sure that the From Email is verified
- Make sure email renders correctly 
- If data is coming in (i.e. a DE was created and info is entering SFMC) it's likely an issue with either the email or Send Classification
