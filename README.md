# SFMC Recipes and Implementation Notes

## Repository Purpose
The purpose of this page is two-fold; 1. to document all of the useful + reusable code that I've written (Recipes)  2. To take note of some important processes I may have to go through again when doing green-field implementations (Implementation Notes)
